Below is a rundown of the application’s features, code components, and folder structure so far:

---

## Application Features

1. **Front Page Listing:**
   - **Cards Display:**  
     Each movie/TV show card shows:
     - Full poster image (using TMDB’s “original” size, displayed with object-contain style so nothing is cropped).
     - Title, release year, and a nicely formatted full release date (day month year).
     - Rating (if zero, it shows “No ratings yet”).
     - Genres (mapped from TMDB genre IDs).
     - Country (for TV shows, shows origin countries; for movies, “N/A”).
     - A "Watch Trailer" button that attempts to fetch a direct YouTube trailer link using TMDB’s video endpoint. If unavailable, it falls back to a YouTube search.

2. **Filtering:**
   - **Filter Options:**  
     Users can filter results by:
     - **Type:** (All, Movies, TV Shows)
     - **Year:** Dropdown from 2000 to the current year (default: current year)
     - **Month:** Dropdown with all months (default: current month)
     - **Genre:** Dropdown with predefined common genres (and later dynamically fetched genres from TMDB)
     - **Country:** Dropdown with options (All, Korea, Spain, Malaysia, China, Thailand, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, India)
     - **Rating:** Dropdown with options “All Ratings” or numbers 0–10 (applied as a minimum vote average)
     - **Streaming Service (Provider):** Dropdown populated dynamically from TMDB’s watch providers (for example, Netflix, Prime, FOX, Starworld, etc.)
   - **Reset Filters:**  
     A reset button returns all filters to their default values.
   - **Auto-update:**  
     Changes on any filter immediately update the URL query parameters and trigger a refetch.

3. **Data Fetching:**
   - An async `getData` function in the main page constructs queries based on filters and calls TMDB’s discover endpoints for movies and TV shows.
   - It also appends parameters for date range, genre, country, rating, and streaming provider.
   - Each item then gets enriched by fetching its trailer URL.
   - When no results match the filters, a friendly “No results found” message is displayed.

4. **Pagination:**
   - A Pagination component displays “Previous” and “Next” buttons.
   - It automatically updates the query parameters and resets the page number when filters change.

5. **Loading State:**
   - A dedicated **/app/loading.tsx** file displays a modern spinner and “Loading…” message while data is being fetched.
